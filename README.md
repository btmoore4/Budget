# Budget Python Backup

The purpose of this project is to import my recent transactions into a SQL DB for further analysis / backup. 
My current budgeting system is mostly supported by Google Sheets, where every transaction is logged and some basic aggregating is done. It is done manually atm, so this script is used to export the Google Sheet data to a database where it can be leveraged further.
